# Ruby Test Task

**Site for demo bank data** `https://demo.bank-on-line.ru/`

**Platform** `Windows 10`

**Ruby** `2.7.2`

**Ide** `RubyMine`

_Decided to make the implementation in 2 separate files for **Watir** and **Nokogiri**._ 

_Though I understand that the task should be done in different steps and these steps to be followed via github commits._

**Commit**: https://github.com/amoscaliuc/ruby-test-task/commit/9a776a2b3a9912e36be78511181c7617138eec30

Contains the _**version #1**_ of the implementation, just on the basis of info gained from tutorials about Ruby


**Book** `Head First O'Reilly`

**Docs** `Tutorials from Test Task description`


#### Difficulties:
* problems with ffi extension, did not notice it should be installed as a separate gem module
* had problems to connect the implementation of data extraction via **watir** and **nokogiri** parsing


#### TODO:
* **implement unit-testing**: _will be implemented in further commits_
* **~~apply code style and code refactor~~**: _done_
